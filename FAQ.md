# F A Q - Frequently Asked Questions #

**Q:** What is **Vidnik**?

If you don't have a built-in camera on your Mac, you can use a Firewire or any Quicktime compatible camera.

**Q**: I have a comment or a question. Where should I put it?

**A**: Please put it in the [Vidnik Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/vidnik?hl=en).

**Q**: I want to report a bug. Where should I report it?

**A**: Please put it in the [Vidnik Issues List](http://code.google.com/p/vidnik/issues/list).


**Q**: How do I get my movies out of **Vidnik**?

**A**: (Control)-Click on a movie thumbnail and you get a popup menu of commands that apply to the current movie. One is "Show in Finder". This reveals the movie clip file in the Finder, so you can do whatever you want with it. Edit it in another movie program.

**Q**: Can I use **Vidnik** to upload to [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) movies I've made somewhere else?

**A**: You can drag movies from the Finder into Vidnik's**table of thumbnails, add the description, tags, title, and upload them all in a single press of the "Upload" button.**


# Future Directions #

**Q**: **Vidnik** is OK, but I wish it did things differently.

**A**: Heh, that's not a question! **Vidnik** is open source. You can fetch the source from this website, build it yourself, and change your copy as you see fit. If you make improvements that I can fold back in to the official **Vidnik**, email me, I'd love to improve it.


# Secrets #

Hold down the (Option) key to reveal some rarely used menu commands:

**New File** - create a new diary document. Most users will just continue to use a single diary document, so they won't need to make additional documents.

**Forget Account** - Your username is normally saved in the diary document, and your password can be stored in your keychain. This command removes your password from the keychain and puts nothing in its place.
